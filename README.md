# Docker Learning Projects

This repository contains my step-by-step Docker learning journey.  
Each Docker concept is explained with a **small practical project**, including a simple application, Dockerfile, commands, and a clear explanation of what I learned.

Instead of only reading theory, I implemented every topic hands-on so I can understand how Docker works internally and externally.  
The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in containerization and demonstrate real, practical Docker skills.

## What you will find in this repo
- Beginner → advanced Docker concepts  
- Each concept organized into its own folder  
- Small example projects for every topic  
- Clean Dockerfiles and docker-compose files  
- Explanations of commands, workflows, and best practices  
- A final project using Docker

## Topics Covered
- Docker Basics 
- Writing Dockerfiles  
- Multi-stage builds  
- Volumes (bind mounts & named volumes)  
- Networking between containers  
- Docker Compose  
- Docker Swarm basics  
- Production-ready container setups  

## Why I built this
To learn Docker properly through real examples and to showcase the practical skills expected in DevOps, backend.
